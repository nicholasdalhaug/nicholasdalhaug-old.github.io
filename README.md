# Custom Fit

This is a simple Progressive Web App(PWA) made for fun. It will ideally become a fully functional app, but the main goal is the implementation of all requirements of a PWA. That is, everything will be made except all of the necessary content for the app to work. 

The idea of the app is that it enables the user to specify different exercises, combine them into routines and do workouts that are basically as realization of those routines. There will not be any public exercise library, both workouts and routines are custom made by each user. But it will simplify the execution of workouts to simple clicks, easy time-taking and a history overview. 

The app is best suited for people that do pure strength workouts regularly. Each exercise has the properties: 
* Workout name
* Pause period: Time between sets
* Number of repetitions
* Number of sets
* Weight
* Increment of weight from one workout to the next of the same rutine

Each routine has: 
* Routine name
* List of exercises
